        "about": "42 offers tuition-free technology education programs in Paris and Silicon Valley. 42 has no teachers or traditional classes. Instead, they use project-based and problem-based learning along with peer code review to foster a tight-knit learning community ready for the tech workplace. Students learn soft skills, creativity, problem-solving, collaboration, communication, and how to work in teams. The 42 curriculum covers subjects in full stack web development, cybersecurity, data visualization, and more. \n\n42 offers an intensive one-year program called Starfleet Academy, in addition to flexible programs that last up to five years. Students are mentored by industry experienced professionals and the school revolves around a project-based \"peer-to-peer” learning model. The curriculum is gamified through experience points, levels, and correction points. Since the curriculum is “mastery-based,” students don't advance to the next section until they've displayed mastery of the skills for that level. \n\nProspective students don’t need a degree or specific technical background to get into 42. In Paris, admission is determined through a series of logic tests to lower the competitive applicant pool (‘Piscine’) down to only the most qualified candidates. In Silicon Valley, applicants must participate in an intensive 28-day basic training with daily coding exercises and challenges.\n\nDuring the course, students in Paris are required to complete at least one internship for 3-6 months. In Silicon Valley, the internship portion is optional. The school provides connections to tech companies by helping students work on company projects and by hosting professionals in guest lectures and career fairs. 42 connects with companies in the Bay Area, from S&P 500 companies to local startups, to ensure they’re meeting hiring needs.\n",

Currently, Code Union offers two courses, Fundamentals of Web Development and SQL Deep-Dive & Metrics. The Fundamentals of Web Development workshop is designed for people who want to be able to build their own prototypes, communicate more effectively with engineers, and/or continue to learn on their own over the rest of their career without feeling lost and disoriented. It is not meant to make people “job ready,” but develop solid fundamentals in software engineering and web development. Ideal for people in design, product management, marketing, ops, and other non-engineering roles that have to work regularly with engineering. Graduates will know their way around the command line, git, Ruby programs, and web applications, including HTML, CSS, and basic SQL and JavaScript. The program avoids advanced frameworks like Rails so students can learn the fundamentals of web development that apply to all web applications. By the end of the class, students will be comfortable building basic web applications, navigating pre-existing code bases, and learning more advanced material on their own without being overwhelmed. The SQL Deep-Dive workshop is designed for people who regularly work with data and want to get their hands dirty — or dirtier. Graduates will learn how to import and export data from a database, the ins-and-outs of SQL and database schema design, and some light programming to write scripts that interact with the database engine of your choice. The program also cover some basic statistics and analytics so you can both ask and answer the right questions. Students will use PostgreSQL as our primary database engine, but will also cover other engines like MySQL and SQLite for comparison. After the workshop, students will be comfortable enough in any database engine that they will be able to focus primarily on the queries they want to write.\n",

Once admitted, students are expected to work full-time for 30 hours per week.\n\nModern Labor works to kickstart the careers of students by having them develop self-initiated projects. These will demonstrate to prospective employers a mastery of the skills needed to be a successful developer. A project manager will assist students by walking them through the various tasks they’ll need to complete. Modern Labor pays its students $2000 a month to learn.

Applicants must be between 18 and 30 years old.\n\nCodam does not work with class schedules or timetables. Instead, students are expected to reach specific milestones within a certain time, but how they do that is up to them.

Located on the Marineterrein, in the heart of Amsterdam, Codam is amongst a growing number of tech initiatives and projects aiming to make open innovation possible. With great access to the technology community, Codam offers a safe and welcoming environment that is available for students 24/7.\n",

In addition to technical skills, students at Interview Kickstart get coaching on productivity and study habits, writing effective resumes, developing LinkedIn profiles, networking, answering behavioral questions, effective recruiter communication, and salary negotiations.\n\nInterview Kickstart courses are not introductory. Applicants should have a comfortable knowledge of at least one programming language. While courses are part-time, they are intense. Instructors, mock interviewers and mentors come from Google, Facebook, Amazon, LinkedIn, Uber, Airbnb, Snap, etc. The remote and in-person programs they lead follow a rigorous methodology for phenomenal results, so courses demand a lot of work. Students should expect interview problems followed by homework, an exit test, and graded mock interviews with feedback. The cost of the course varies based on a students’ level of experience.\n\nSince its inception, Interview Kickstart is proud to have several graduates land jobs at their dream companies like Airbnb, Amazon, Apple, Docker, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Lyft, Microsoft, Netflix, Tesla, Uber, etc. Previous graduates received offers from entry-level to engineering management.\n",

        "about": "American University is a Cybersecurity bootcamp located in Washington, D.C. The American University bootcamp is powered by HackerU, a cybersecurity training institute. Students can choose one of two certification programs: Ethical Hacking or Cybersecurity. Students of the Cybersecurity bootcamp will be prepared to take the Network+, CSK, Linux LPI Essential, CCNA CyberOps, Security+, (ISC)2 SSCP, CySA+, and CCNA certification exams. Students of the Ethical Hacking bootcamp will be prepared to take the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) exam and the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) exam. The Cybersecurity bootcamp teaches security for Windows, cloud, cyber infrastructure, Linux, network, and Python. This bootcamp also teaches Game Theory, which helps students step inside the mind of a hacker to offensively defend against cyber threats. The Ethical Hacking bootcamp teaches Python programming as well as Offensive Security techniques including Pass the Ticket, Pass the Hash, and the Metasploit and Veil frameworks. Both American University courses offer hands-on and project-based learning through Immersive Simulation Cyber Labs. \n\nThe Cybersecurity program is suitable for everyone, including beginners and those with some self-taught experience in the field. The Ethical Hacking bootcamp is open only to those with a Computer Science degree or those with comparable work experience as an IT professional, programmer, or software developer. Potential students for either program are required to first complete a 30-hour introductory course. After this 30-hour course, students will be asked to take an exam and assessment before moving forward into the full program. If students choose not to move forward into the full program after the introductory course, they are eligible for a 50% tuition refund.  \n\nAmerican University’s bootcamps are designed to get graduates jobs. Career Services administrators help students throughout the bootcamp’s duration with resumes, cover letters, professional networking, and industry-specific interviewing. Instructors help students connect with alumni and top businesses in the area, and an internship assistance program is also available, though placement is not guaranteed.\n",
